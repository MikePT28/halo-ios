It’s time to take it off!<br></strong>Putting your roof rack on only when you need it could save you up to 5% more fuel according to the US Department of Energy website.</p>  <p><strong>Tyre pressure</strong><br>If your tyres are under inflated by just 3psi, fuel efficiency can be reduced by up to 1% - according to a European report in 2004 by the Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy. So check tyres once a week or whenever you fill up. This is not only a great way to save fuel, it’s safer too.</p>  <p><strong>Avoid excess idling</strong><br>Idling gets you nowhere, but still burns fuel. If you’re likely to be in a queue for more than ten seconds, turn your engine off until you need it. Next time you are on the school run, remember this tip to help you save fuel.</p>",

            "ContentHtml": "<p>A driving story in Amsterdam, the city of bicycles? A city linked in the main by canals? Is someone playing a cruel joke on me? Fortunately not. There’s no joking involved. As for the cruelty – well, there’s only one way to find out...</p> <p>Bicycles rule the city for the simple fact that on two wheels, you can whistle through the narrowest of streets while a car will be log-jammed at snail’s pace, caught in one giant three-point turn around a city which prides itself on keeping the automobile at bay.</p> <p>But I’ve always liked a challenge, and sit me in something compact, a little adrenalin-fuelling two-seater sports car, and I will give those crazy exercise fiends a run for their trainers – while remaining snug and smug should it decide to rain.</p> <p><strong>Oosteliijke Obstruction</strong></p> <p>My first encounter with the city’s two-wheeled inhabitants occurs as I unload my bags in front of my hotel, the Lloyd, in the hip, eastern docks area. It’s a few minutes before I realise that I’ve become a mobile roundabout, causing a temporary halt in the bike lane. The road is dead straight for about half-a-mile either side of the hotel, so how they hadn’t spotted me is anyone’s guess. But I quickly realise that those foolish enough to venture into the bicycle lane will inevitably attract internationally recognised statements of abuse.</p> <p>It is dusk here on Oostelijke Handelskade, a 2km long island on which my hotel sits. I fire up the motor and set a course for the city centre. I cruise past some old warehouses, most of which were constructed in the late 1800s and named after the countries the ships and steamboats were sailing to. But these warehouses are slowly disappearing and being replaced by ultra-modern buildings, including the stunning Muziekgebouw Concert Hall, an incredible marriage of glass and concrete. I pull over to get a better look.</p> <p>In the distance I make out Nemo, Renzo Piano’s ship-like science museum which stands high out of this virtually flat cityscape. But there is so much more to see, so I cruise along the roads alongside cyclists and trams, under a bright, white moon. Many residents are escaping Amsterdam for the weekend, like the ebb and flow of tide.</p> <p><strong>Starry Night</strong></p> <p>I move on to Prinsengracht, the location of Anne Frank’s house, extended in 1999 to great effect. Here at 4am, only the ripple of wake from a passing swan interrupts its reflection across the water. It is so tranquil. In contrast, nearby Jordaan is a Mecca for cafes, art galleries and studios, and even at this hour its inhabitants are slipping in and out of doorways. While other residents of the city continue to sleep, I head to another art zone, the Fashion and museum District with the van Gogh museum positioned centrally in the park alongside Paulus Potterstraat.</p> <p>A chink of dawn opens above me, a slash of palest purple among the inky blackness of night. Sitting in the warmth of the car and cruising the cobbled streets around the Rijksmuseum, this is a cosy place to be, despite the temporarily uneven surface. I veer off it soon enough and head along Stadhouderskade, which is suddenly rammed with cycling commuters, trams and buses. Crossing the Binnenamstel canal with its bridges made famous by Van Gogh, I feel as though I have stepped into one of the artist’s canvases.</p> <p>Shops are opening now, closed signs are coming off doors and Amsterdam is stretching its limbs in the morning sunshine.  Breakfast calls and so does the road home, sadly. I like Amsterdam and its people. There are many ways of seeing the city, but by night in a car that can provide warmth and comfort has got to be the best.</p> ",

            "ContentHtml": "<p>Barcelona, prepare to reveal your night-time secrets. We sent journalist Jane Cloete to the midnight streets of the Catalan capital to find a secret circuit.</p> <p>I’m here to tackle Barcelona and to explore the best of the city while its inhabitants sleep. I knew Barcelona would be tricky though, as it’s famous for its late-night dining and party atmosphere, but I’m up for the challenge. I begin at the highest point in Barcelona, on the mountain of Tibidabo.<br> <br> The drive down the steep hill back into town is tight, twisty and fun. If the city centre wasn’t calling, I might be tempted to head along the coast.<br> <br> First stop is Antoni Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia. It’s almost 11.30pm, but tourists are still milling around the famous Catholic church that’s been under construction since 1882. Barcelona is now synonymous with the architect, and pictures of his signature flamboyant, otherworldly work grace pretty much every printed tourist guide for the city.</p> <p><strong>Catalan Extravagance</strong><br> I cruise down Carrer de Provença, one of the long, straight and very wide roads in the Eixample district. After a few blocks it’s a wide left corner into Passeig de Gràcia, Barcelona’s well-known shopping street. Allegedly the most expensive street in the country, it offers up designer stores, excellent restaurants and cafes, plus some of the city’s best-known buildings. I slow down outside another Gaudi building, Casa Mila, appreciating Gaudi’s now recognisable undulating lines and the rather wonderful Espanta Bruixes chimneys.<br> <br> There’s no point in speeding up, because casa Batlló – yes, another Gaudi building – is soon on my right. The city has considerately placed benches outside the building, and these are now filled with visitors, gawping up as their cameras capture close-ups and wide-angles of Batlló’s animal-mask-like balconies and dragon-spine roof.<br> <br> The road ends at the famous square Plaça de Cataluña, and I’m just in time to see the last few minutes of the illuminated fountains before they hit their midnight curfew.<br> <br> I turn down la Rambla, the famed party street with its wide pedestrianised central section, and the youthful revellers up their challenge. They’re not making it easy for me – despite it being a tuesday night, supposedly one of the quietest of the week. The smiling, jovial crowd is being catered to by tapas restaurants, bars, stalls, artists - no one shows any signs of tiring out.</p> <p><strong>Liechtenstein at the Olympics</strong><br> I’m not going to win now so, as soon as I can, I turn left into Barri Gòtic, Barcelona’s gothic Quarter. This is the oldest part of the city, and one of the nicest to walk through during the day. At night the atmosphere is quite haunting, and without the crowds you’re able to appreciate the grandeur of places such as the Plaça de Sant Jaume. This square has always been the home of important government buildings – even during Roman times – and today the city hall faces the Palau de la Generalitat (seat of the Catalan government).<br> <br> I’ve spent a few hours slowly exploring the tangled, narrow streets of the quarter with only a few pedestrians and policemen for company, so it’s off to the waterfront, which has completely changed the face of Barcelona. To get there I drive round the 20-metre-high Roy Lichtenstein sculpture, Barcelona Head, which was inspired by Gaudi and commissioned for the Olympics. To stay close to the sea, I drive up and down he fingers of land that stretch out into the water.<br> <br> My last hope for peace in the city is back in the quieter gothic Quarter. So, taking the Via Laietana, I pull up outside the Museum of History of Barcelona. It’s 5am and I’m going to enjoy the silence while admiring the building that contains evidence of the city’s 2,000-year past. Just then, the first of the morning’s dog walkers strolls by with a cheery “Buenos dias!” That’s it! Barcelona has beaten me. But with the warmth of its locals, the beauty of its architecture and the vibrancy of its waterfront, I’m happy to admit defeat.</p> ",

Why? He thought, “it would make a good story”. It does…</p> <p>I knew the idea of crossing the Sahara on a road bike was ambitious, but I had no idea how hard it would actually be.<br> <br> At the Moroccan border I’m immediately unnerved by some Frenchmen. They look at my bike and shake their heads; “you’re taking this on the piste?” The 1,130cc machine still looks box-fresh and ill-prepared for one of the planet’s toughest environments.</p> <p><strong>Taking on the Piste</strong><br> “Oui,” I reply, wondering what a piste looks like. Soon I’m into the no-man’s-land between the Moroccan and Mauritanian borders. Now it’s a piste. I soon learn that this term defines every surface that can be travelled on – from smooth dirt road to rugged wilderness.  <br> <br> The 135bhp bike starts acting like it’s drunk. I ride slowly, paddling with my feet when the sand is deep. I’m soon in the Mauritanian town of Nouadhibou.</p> <p><strong>Mauritanian Madness</strong><br> It’s post-apocalypse fiction brought to life. The cars have no headlights or windows; most look like they’ve been rolled a dozen times. Locals give me dead-eyed, zombie-like stares. The architecture is Mogadishu-chic. In among the madness my bike has become invisible. Nothing gives me an inch. I’d be safer on a donkey.<br> <br> Sanctuary is found in a walled campsite full of Europeans. Tomorrow I’ll start on the real purpose of the journey – riding in the Sahara. For that I’ll need a guide. I hook up with two Dutch guys driving to Gambia. The guide will travel in their car and I can follow. As guides go, Mr Abba certainly looks the part: a dark-skinned Arab in his mid-50s wearing a Bedouin’s flowing, white robe and head dress. He doesn’t seem fazed about taking the bike along, though he takes a long, close look at the fat rear tyre.<br> <br> The next day we’re out on the piste. There may be some tarmac here, but the riding is hot, dusty work demanding concentration. After 55 miles the car turns right, off the piste and into the Sahara desert. My mouth dries in an instant.</p> <p><strong>Doing Things the Hard Way</strong><br> Now I know I need to relax and just keep the front wheel pointing in the direction I want it to go and the rear will follow. I know I should try standing up. I know I should grip the bars lightly. But I sit down and hold on with white-knuckle ferocity. I have little faith in myself and close to none in the road tyres. All I do is stare at the Dutchmen’s car and try to follow. It’s painfully slow going. At times it’s just painful.<br> <br> At one point I haven’t fallen off for close to an hour, my confidence has risen and I make the mistake of attempting a turn in the sand. Then I’m down and pinned to the floor. I have time to reflect on just how much fun I’m having - none. After four hours we make a proper stop and Mr Abba brews a pot of mint tea.<br> <br> “You look like an accident happening in slow motion,” I’m told. But I feel remarkably upbeat. Mr Abba points to a mountain in the distance and says we’re staying beyond that. The day no longer feels like it’s going to last forever. 2 hours later, we’re past the mountain and spend the night at a small Bedouin camp.</p> <p><br> <strong>The Finishing Line</strong><br> The next morning I crash within five miles of an 80-mile day on the sand. I’ve no choice but to get back in the saddle and keep riding. My reward is being taught a lesson in life: it doesn’t matter how much talent you lack, perseverance can often paper over the cracks.<br> <br> My last night in the desert is spent in a tent on the beach with the Atlantic crashing a few feet away. Home aside, it’s the best destination I’ve ever reached on a bike. I’m no longer scared of dying in the desert or of crashing and breaking bones. I’ve ridden a bike fitted with road tyres through a gruelling section of the Sahara. I know that’s a first.</p>",

Shell is looking forward to working closely with the four-time World Champion and using his extensive knowledge and experience to help develop Shell’s fuels and lubricants of the future.</p> <p><strong>Kai-Uwe Witterstein, Shell Global Sponsorship Manager, </strong>commented:<em> “We are very pleased with the Ferrari SF15-T and look forward to seeing it on track for the first time in Jerez this weekend. Shell has worked closely with Scuderia Ferrari to prepare for the 2015 season. The challenge Ferrari presents us with is that we always have to stretch ourselves to be better than the year before, we have to push ourselves even further.”</em></p> <p><em>“At Shell, we see the Ferrari partnership as a great opportunity to develop the best products for our customers. It’s not just about Ferrari, it’s also about access to Formula One and all its advanced technology because this is where you come up with new ideas.” </em></p> <p><strong>View Ferrari launch video here:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://2015f1car.ferrari.com/desktop/en/#revelation\">http://2015f1car.ferrari.com/desktop/en/#revelation</a></p> <p>In 2014 the challenges faced by the two companies, developing a revolutionary powertrain and optimising fuels and lubricants to meet last year’s new regulations, were some of the most demanding ever confronted. Those challenges continue in 2015, as the number of power units available to each driver over the course of the season has been reduced from last year’s total of five to just four. This means Scuderia Ferrari has been looking to Shell to provide fuels and lubricants that increase protection throughout this extended engine life while still enhancing performance.</p> <p>Speaking about the upcoming season, <strong>Guy Lovett, Shell Technology Manager for Ferrari</strong>, commented: <em>“Shell’s contribution to the performance of Scuderia Ferrari’s power unit is crucial. We have worked extremely closely with the team in the build up to the 2015 season to ensure that our Shell V-Power fuel and Shell Helix Ultra with PurePlus technology lubricant can meet the demands of its latest evolution. Now we are looking forward to seeing how the SF15-T performs on the track this weekend and throughout the winter tests before making the final adjustments needed to be ready for the first F1 race in Melbourne.”</em></p>",

            "Summary": "Shell premium motor oils Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum to power BMW Motorsport and Shell V-Power becomes the premium fuel recommended by BMW M Automobiles",
            "ContentHtml": "<p>Shell is expanding its collaboration with the BMW AG, following on from being named the recommended supplier of genuine BMW engine oil and BMW Group’s only recommended global supplier for aftermarket motor oils. Shell Lubricants – Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum – joins forces with BMW Motorsport as its premium technology partner and exclusive supplier of premium motor oils. And Shell V-Power will be the recommended fuel for the BMW M Automobiles.</p> <p>The lubricants’ partnership spans Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship (USCC) and the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife circuit (Germany) covering races in Austria, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia and the USA.</p> <p>The types of racing covered are varied: ranging from the well-established sedan-racing DTM series, which is among the most popular touring car series in the world, to the newbie USCC series, only in its second season, combining a heritage of road and endurance racing in North America, and not forgetting the pure endurance of the Nürburgring 24-hour race. Shell’s involvement in motor racing helps Shell to develop its range of products for the everyday motorist: this new link up strengthens this commitment.</p> <p>The fuels alliance means Shell V-Power Gasoline and Shell V-Power Diesel are recommended for the BMW M Automobiles recognising more than 100 years heritage in innovation and fuels leadership. With its unique formulations designed to actively clean and protect vital engine parts, Shell V-Power is seen as an ideal partner for BMW M Automobiles, BMWs pinnacle of technology.</p> <p>Speaking on the tie-up, Mark Gainsborough, Shell Executive Vice President said, “Shell has passion for motor racing, as demonstrated by our long standing involvement in the international motorsport arena. We are excited to be expanding this involvement as BMW Motorsport’s partner, in addition to being the BMW Group’s recommended supplier of aftermarket engine oils.</p> <p>The partnership with BMW highlights the significant contribution that our brands such as Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum motor oils and Shell V-Power fuels can make to the performance of BMW cars both on and off the track. This collaboration will enable two like-minded companies to push the boundaries of both motor oil, fuel and engine development - hopefully for the ultimate benefit of the everyday car driver.”</p> <p>Motor oils are crucial in ensuring engine durability and enabling vehicle efficiency and performance. Their cleansing, friction reduction and temperature control properties are important contributors to durability and performance. Evolving motorsport race rules have made the use of premium oils even more vital for an ambitious race team such as BMW. For example each DTM manufacturer is only permitted nine engines to last the full 2015 season. In pre-season testing, BMW Motorsport has already seen enhanced performance benefits to the engine from using Shell Helix Ultra with PurePlus Technology.</p> <p>“Everyone at BMW Motorsport is delighted that we can count on the support of Shell in the future, both in DTM and USCC, as well as the Nürburgring 24 Hours,” said BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Shell Helix Ultra and Pennzoil Platinum as products are perfectly suited to our motorsport projects. We are putting our faith in these high-performance motor oils, and hope that the new partnership will allow us to lay the foundation for great success together on the racetrack.”</p> <p>Shell will allocate a dedicated team of engineers, who will work alongside BMW Motorsport engineers. They will apply decades of motorsport experience to develop a bespoke blend of motor oil for the BMW M4 DTM car. This development will be on-going during testing and the race season.</p>",

            "ContentHtml": "<p>This weekend, the start of the 2015 FIA Formula 1™ World Championship saw the 80<sup>th</sup> driver to join forces with Scuderia Ferrari and Shell since the founding of the series in 1950. The man in question, who made his team debut with a podium finish in Melbourne at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, is four-time world champion, Sebastian Vettel.</p> <p>Sebastian arrived alongside his great friend Kimi Räikkönen at Scuderia Ferrari to bring a unique mix of determination, experience and fun to the most celebrated team in the sport.</p> <p>Born in 1987 and driving karts from the age of three, Sebastian graduated to racing cars at the age of 16. Just three years later, the youngster from Heppenheim in Germany made his debut at the sport’s highest level in the United States Grand Prix with the Sauber team.</p> <p>Sebastian ended that race in eighth place, setting a record as the youngest points-scoring driver in Formula One history, at 19 years and 349 days. The young prodigy swiftly moved to a full-time drive with Scuderia Toro Rosso and, with Ferrari  engine, continued to make waves through his first full F1 season in 2008.</p> <p>His crowning achievement was to take victory from pole position at the rain-soaked Italian Grand Prix – setting another record as the youngest Grand Prix winner at 21 years and 74 days.</p> <p>The most significant record of achievement by a young driver was still to come. Transferring to Red Bull Racing from 2009, Sebastian gained experience and further race victories until a dramatic finish to the 2010 season saw him crowned the youngest ever Formula One world champion at the age of just 23 years and 135 days.</p> <p>Nobody in the history of Grand Prix racing has achieved as much at such a young age. Yet it is not simply how quickly Sebastian Vettel joined the most elite group of sportsmen in history that sets him apart – it is the level of sheer dominance that he has achieved.</p> <p>In 2011 he set records for the most pole positions in a season (9), the most front row starting positions (18) and the most laps led (739). In 2013 he claimed the highest number of points amassed in a single season (397) and the most race wins (13) among which is the record for the most consecutive victories (9).</p> <p>There are other records too – not least the number of crash helmet designs ever sported by any driver in the history of the sport (“I have a quirk,” Sebastian reflected in 2013).</p> <p>In the pantheon of world championship legends, the first driver to truly dominate the sport was Juan Manuel Fangio. After winning his first three world championship titles with Alfa Romeo and Mercedes, the Maestro joined Scuderia Ferrari – where the combination of his mesmerising abilities with the partnership between Ferrari and Shell proved unstoppable.</p> <p>Nearly 60 years after Fangio, another dominant force in the sport has begun to write his chapter in the story of Scuderia Ferrari and Shell. Ciao, Sebastian – welcome to the family.</p>",

            "ContentHtml": "<p>Victory at Le Mans is a prize so precious and so elusive that Hollywood legend Steve McQueen threw his career away trying to capture what it means on celluloid. After 45 years the magic and mystery of racing around the clock is undiminished.</p> <p>In McQueen’s brilliantly flawed opus Le Mans, filmed during the actual 1970 Le Mans 24 hours, the battle was between Porsche and Ferrari – both of which ran on Shell fuel. Today Porsche has returned to the Circuit de la Sarthe to do battle with Audi and Toyota – and once again they will all be running on Shell fuel.</p> <p>The race is shaping up to be a thriller. In the first two races of this year’s FIA World Endurance Championship, the six hour ‘sprints’ at Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, it is the diesel-fuelled hybrid Audi R18 e-tron quattro of André Lotterer, Benoît Tréluyer and Marcel Fässler that has triumphed – but only by the narrowest of margins.</p> <p>At Silverstone Audi crossed the line in front of Porsche and Toyota with just 14 seconds between the three of them. At the 6 Hours of Spa Audi’s margin was 13 seconds over the second placed Porsche.</p> <p>The ferocity of the battle between these prestige brands is electrifying. Fans have relished lap after lap of wheel-to-wheel action between the drivers while the pit crews have been locked in their own battles of strategy, strength and rapid turn-around.</p> <p>Yet as double winner André Lotterer has said: “You have got to respect Le Mans and the clock now gets re-set to zero.”</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>For A start Le Mans equals the same distance as a full Formula 1 season non-stop in the space of 24 hours. The speeds are phenomenal – with 220 mph expected to be seen on the straights and lap times around the 13.629 km circuit dipping as low as 3 minutes 12 seconds.</p> <p>In theory, the Audi is the least powerful of the contenders. Its hybrid powertrain of a 4.0-litre V8 turbodiesel mated to an advanced hybrid system releases 134.8 megajoules of engine power and 4 megajoules of hybrid energy per lap. </p> <p>By contrast Porsche’s 2.0-litre V4 turbocharged petrol engine has 8 megajoules of hybrid power and 138 megajoules available from its engine, while Toyota’s non-turbo 3.7 litre V8 engine has 6 megajoules of hybrid power and 139.5 megajoules of petrol energy to call upon each lap.</p> <p>On track Porsche has dominated qualifying in 2015 – locking out the first three positions on the grid at Spa – but overall Audi’s slippery bodywork has given it a speed advantage. Reigning world champions Toyota qualified on pole position for Le Mans last year and lost the race only with a late electrical fault but have struggled to recapture that form so far in 2015.</p> <p>Each of the three manufacturers’ three-car armadas must also negotiate the other 47 cars on the grid, which will all be in their own race of endurance. These include the brand new front-engined Nissan and the ‘lightweight’ privateer entries of ByKolles and the Shell-backed Rebellion squad.</p> <p>Then there are the LMP2 prototypes for aspiring Le Mans winners of the future and the mightily impressive production-based supercars of the GT classes in which stalwarts Aston Martin, Corvette, Ferrari and Porsche are joined by the Dodge Viper for this year’s race.</p> <p>With 56 cars competing in five intensely competitive classes for 24 hours, the 2015 Le Mans 24 Hours is set to thrill. With the support of bespoke Shell V-Power LM24 and Shell V-Power Diesel LM24 fuels designed to maximise power and minimise consumption, we look forward to sharing an amazing weekend of sporting achievement and drama.</p>",

In other words drivers who are not properly hydrated make the same number of errors as people who are over the drink drive limit."</p> <p>Despite the relatively small sample size of the study, with driver errors accountable for two thirds of all vehicle crashes in the UK, the European Hydration Institute are urging drivers to be cautious and ensure they are adequately hydrated, especially during the warmer summer months. In addition to water all non-alcoholic drinks hydrate, and having a variety throughout the day increases the likelihood of adequate fluid intake.</p> <p>The idea that dehydration worsens driving ability has been validated in this research, however due to a small sample size it is recommended that larger studies are conducted.</p> <p>To find out more <a href=\"http://www.europeanhydrationinstitute.org/dehydrated-drivers-make-the-same-number-of-mistakes-as-drink-drivers/\">click here</a></p>",

Beyond that, it has also committed to continue to dedicate at least 21,000 man hours and 50 full time technical staff every year.</p> <p>Shell will also have a permanent technical staff presence at Ferrari’s Maranello headquarters going forward, a further measure of the increased collaboration to come between the two companies.</p> <p>“Shell’s goal is to help power Scuderia Ferrari to an 11th Constructors’ Championship title in partnership with Shell,” said Shell’s Downstream Director, John Abbott.</p> <p>“Of course, fuels and motor oil are just two of the many parts that need to come together for a Formula 1 car to cross the finish line first. As our relationship with the most successful team in Formula 1 evolves, we are determined to help bring success to the Scuderia, and develop even better fuels and lubricants for our millions of customers.”</p> <p>Ferrari Team Principal Maurizio Arrivabene also hailed the new agreement, saying: “The signing of this contract is another step forward on the path to stability, and we are delighted to work with Shell on an extended basis.</p> <p>"Historically the engine is at the very core of Ferrari, which means that everything we do with Shell is working around our heritage as an engine constructor. Already this season the work that Shell has done has contributed to our wins in Malaysia and Hungary, which is proof of not only a professional commitment, but is also the result of a great partnership as well."</p> <p>Shell’s partnership with Ferrari will also stretch beyond Formula 1, with Shell set to provide fuel and lubricants to Ferrari GT teams entering the FIA World Endurance Championship and the Le Mans 24 Hours.</p> <p>In keeping with this agreement’s spirit of innovation, Ferrari will also support Shell’s global Eco-marathon programme going forward, offering members of the successful teams a four-week internship in Maranello.</p>",
